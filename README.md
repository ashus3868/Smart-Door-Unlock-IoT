# IoT Door Unlock System with ESP32 and MQTT | ESP-IDF

Welcome to the repository for the "IoT Door Unlock System using ESP32 and MQTT" tutorial. In this project, we explore the world of Internet of Things (IoT) by creating a smart door unlock system using the ESP32 microcontroller and MQTT communication protocol with the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework).

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a secure and efficient door unlock system that can be integrated into your smart home setup. The ESP32 microcontroller provides the brains, and MQTT ensures seamless communication between devices. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this repository aims to be a helpful resource for understanding the integration of ESP32, MQTT, and ESP-IDF.

## Key Features

- **ESP-IDF Basics:** Learn the fundamentals of ESP-IDF, Espressif's official development framework for the ESP32.

- **MQTT Protocol:** Understand the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol and its role in IoT communication.

- **Door Unlock System:** Build a fully functional IoT-based door unlock system using the ESP32, complete with a motor or servo for the lock mechanism.

- **Security Enhancements:** Explore the integration of sensors for enhanced security features, such as authentication and authorization.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have the necessary hardware, including an ESP32 development board, motor or servo, and any additional sensors you'd like to incorporate.

2. **Setting Up ESP-IDF:** Follow the instructions in the provided documentation to set up the ESP-IDF environment on your development machine.

3. **MQTT Broker:** Choose and set up an MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto) for facilitating communication between devices.

4. **Code Implementation:** Dive into the code provided in the repository, understanding each component and customization options.

5. **Testing and Troubleshooting:** Follow the testing guidelines to ensure a smooth implementation and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
